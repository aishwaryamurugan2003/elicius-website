                  At Elicius Energy, we envision a future where industries thrive
                  sustainably through innovations in chemical engineering and data
                  science. Our expert team delivers tailor-made solutions with a strong
                  commitment to environmental stewardship.

                  We are pioneering Proton Exchange Membrane–based tubular fuel cell
                  stacks, enabling silent, clean power with superior power density.
                  Our work spans physics-based and system-level modelling of fuel cells
                  and alkaline water electrolysers, including performance, efficiency,
                  and degradation studies.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In parallel, we are developing low-cost air quality monitoring and
                  road condition monitoring devices to combat pollution and improve
                  urban infrastructure for a healthier future.
